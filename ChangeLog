Release 2.2.0
  - Protocol routines rewrite.
  - Slave ack is now read.
  - SetDebug and SetPrintError functions to enable or disable debug or error
    output.
  - The same source can build a i386 and mpc860 kernel module.
  - SelectI2CprinterPort is extended with printerport 3. This is a parallel port
    on a pci card with base address 0xD000 (Thanks Philippe Martinole).

Release 2.1.2
  - Device and direct port interface functions are now function pointers to avoid
    an extra function and switch.
  - k8000.h header fixes to link C++ against the C libk8000.a. libk8000++.a does
    not exist anymore.

Release 2.1.1
  - Compile bugfix in k8000.h

Release 2.1.0
  - Introduced mutexes to serialize parallel port access

Release 2.0.1
  - Fixed a dumb bug only visible on big endian platforms.

Release 2.0.0
  - Added examples directory with some simple C and C++ examples
  - The scripts directory contains setup scripts for the /dev interface

Release 1.99.2
  - The user can now select the 'direct' or 'via i2c kernel device' methode at run time
    of his/her program.
    No more need to choose at compile time.
    The -lk8000dev(++) compiler options are not used anymore.

Release 1.99.1
  - Added choice to use I2C kernel device access to k8000 instead of direct printer port
    access.
    This is done at link time. By choosing -lk8000(++) for direct access to printerport.
    Or -lk8000dev(++) for access via I2C kernel device.
    Added by hihihi@wanadoo.nl after Heimo Schoen showed how to do it for IO channels in
    the 'Velleman K8000 & Linux Howto' http://howto.htlw16.ac.at/k8000-howto.html

  - Added range checking for DA and DAC channels.
  - Minor bugs fixed.

Release 1.99
  - Complete core code rewrite to make the source more readable.
  - Fix automatic permission setting bug.
  - Added support for 5 master-slave chains. Those 5 chains use
	  different pins on the parallel port, see the README for
	  more details.
  - Added 2 generic I²C functions: I2cSendData and I2cReadData
	  that can be used to send some data to other I²C devices than a
	  Velleman K8000 (like LCD panels, Eeproms,..).
  - No more separate tarballs for C and C++ libraries. The 2 flavours
	  are made from one source. The same is true for the rpm's, only
	  one rpm for both flavours.
  - Ditched the C++ header (k8000++.h) since it's exactly the same
	  as k8000.h

Release 1.1.0
  - SelectI2CprinterPort function now sets the
	  permissions on the desired printer port, and
	  returns non zero uppon failure
  - Added SetAutoPerm function to disable the
	  automatic permission setting in SelectI2CprinterPort

Release 1.0.0
  - Initial release
